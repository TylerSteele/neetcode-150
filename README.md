# NeetCode-150

My solutions and reflections on the [NeetCode 150 problems](https://neetcode.io/practice?tab=neetcode150).

Each entry will contain my first passing solution and reflections. Of course, my first passing solution will not be the optimal one, but there's little point in me copying the best solutions in my journal. The point is to learn by examination and measure my growth as I complete problems.

In some (many?) cases, I will need to watch the video or use other resources to figure out the solution. In these situations, I'll still record my thought process so I can identify where I got stuck and what my blind spot was.
